## 1. Superstore Sales Forecasting

**Problem:** Predict next 7 days of sales for inventory and staffing optimization

**Approach:**
- Analyzed 4 years (9,800 transactions) of retail sales data
- Identified weekly patterns (Saturday +35%, Thursday -60%) and yearly seasonality (Nov peak +90%)
- Built Facebook Prophet model capturing trend + seasonality

**Results:**
- **7-day forecast:** $12,012 total revenue (Dec 31 - Jan 6)
- **Key insight:** Business growing 60% (2015-2018) despite stable appearance
- **Recommendations:** 
  - Reduce Jan 3-4 staffing (predicted $400-1,178/day)
  - Maximize weekend resources (Saturday peak days)

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Prophet, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 2. NFL Receiving Analytics

**Problem:** Which Patriots receivers are most efficient, and how do they compare league-wide?

**Approach:**
- Scraped 2025 NFL receiving stats from Pro Football Reference
- Analyzed target distribution, catch rates, first down conversions for Patriots
- Compared against 5 other teams (SEA, IND, DEN, PHI, LAR)

**Results:**
- **Target concentration:** Top 3 receivers capture [X]% of targets
- **Efficiency leader:** [Player] converts [X]% catches to first downs
- **Saturday effect:** Highest reception day across league

**Recommendations:**
- Feature high first-down converters on 3rd downs
- Diversify targets to prevent defensive keying
- Benchmark efficiency metrics for contract negotiations

**Tools:** Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Seaborn

## 3. Fitbit Activity Analysis

**Problem:** What's the relationship between daily steps and calories burned?

**Approach:**
- Analyzed Fitbit activity data across 30+ users
- Regression analysis: steps (independent) vs calories (dependent)
- Visualized correlation with confidence intervals

**Results:**
- **Strong positive correlation:** More steps = higher calorie burn (linear relationship)
- **Individual variation:** Metabolic differences create scatter around trend
- **Predictive value:** Step count reliably estimates daily calorie expenditure

**Applications:**
- Personalized fitness goal setting (calculate steps needed for calorie targets)
- Anomaly detection (unusual calorie-to-step ratios flag device/health issues)
- Corporate wellness programs (evidence-based step challenges)

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Regression Analysis

## 💼 What I Bring to Analytics Teams

✅ **Business-First Thinking:** Start with the problem, not the data  
✅ **End-to-End Execution:** From data collection → analysis → actionable recommendations  
✅ **Clear Communication:** Technical insights translated for non-technical stakeholders  
✅ **Self-Sufficient:** Web scraping, data cleaning, modeling without hand-holding  
✅ **Impact-Oriented:** Every analysis answers "so what?" and "now what?"
